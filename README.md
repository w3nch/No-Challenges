# No-Challenges

**No-Challenges** is a personal collection of beginner-to-intermediate level CTF-style web challenges created and hosted by [w3nch](https://github.com/w3nch). This repo is meant for self-hosted testing, challenge sharing, and skill sharpening for security learners.

## üïµÔ∏è What‚Äôs Inside

This repo contains a set of static files used for hosting browser-based CTF web challenges.

### Files:

| File          | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `index.html`  | Main landing page of the challenge set |
| `app.js`      | JavaScript logic used for one or more challenges |
| `styles.css`  | Styling for the front-end |
| `secret.html` | Hidden page‚Äîflag or clue may be buried here |
| `robots.txt`  | Used to hint or block certain paths from search engines (or scanners) |
| `.github/workflows/static.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow for auto-deploy to GitHub Pages |
